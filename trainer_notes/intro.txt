Intro concepts:

- Pair programming is essential
   - Explain pair programming
   - Cost vs Risk when refactoring large codebases
   - This is not a competition, you don't have to demonstrate anything
   - Be honest, use your empathy.

- What is refactoring:
   - Original book and catalog by Martin Fowler
   - Code smells
   - Refactoring to patterns - Joshua Kerievsky
   - Narrow Chage and Parallel Change - Joshua Kerievsky
   - Power of the IDEs

- Benefits of refactoring:
   - Enrich de codebase with business knowledge
   - Lower the maintenance cost
   - Better understanding of the code
   - Collective code ownership
   - Simplicity
   - Testability
   - Why to be proficient? the more you do it, the more likely you will do it!
      - 10 minutes refactoring per day. Warm up with a refactoring kata

- Approaches:
   - Plan for the strategy first
   - Mikado method approach
   - Baby steps, always on green. Do not lean on the compiler
   - Run the tests constantly. Check-in code constantly
   - Micro commits, exploratory refactorings and branches:
       - Scratch refactorings according to M. Feathers
       - Review the diff before the commit
   - The low hanging fruit. Go for the easy and obvious parts first.   
   -  Refactor on green, not on red
   -  Have a test plan, test manually and throughly
   - Review IntelliJ analysis tools for dependencies
   - IDE:
       - Some refactors require underlying text, some others just the cursor 
     on top.
   - Narrow Change & Parallel Change
